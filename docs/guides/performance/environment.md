The environment where DuckDB is run has an obvious impact on performance. This page focuses on the effects of the hardware configuration and the operating system used.

## Hardware Configuration

### CPU and Memory

As a rule of thumb, DuckDB requires a **minimum** of 125 MB of memory per thread.
For example, if you use 8 threads, you need at least 1 GB of memory.
For ideal performance, aggregation-heavy workloads require approx. 5 GB memory per thread and join-heavy workloads require approximately 10 GB memory per thread.

> Bestpractice Aim for 5-10 GB memory per thread.

> Tip If you have a limited amount of memory, try to [limit the number of threads]({% link docs/configuration/pragmas.md %}#threads), e.g., by issuing `SET threads = 4;`.

### Disk

DuckDB is capable of operating both as an in-memory and as a disk-based database system. In both cases, it can spill to disk to process larger-than-memory workloads (a.k.a. out-of-core processing) for which a fast disk is highly beneficial. However, if the workload fits in memory, the disk speed only has a limited effect on performance.

### Local Disk

DuckDB's disk-based mode is designed to work best with SSD and NVMe disks. While HDDs are supported, they will result in low performance, especially for write operations.

### Network-Attached Disks

**Cloud disks.** DuckDB runs well on network-backed cloud disks such as [AWS EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) for both read-only and read-write workloads.

**Network-attached storage.**
Network-attached storage can serve DuckdB for read-only workloads.
However, _it is not recommended to run DuckDB in read-write mode on network-attached storage (NAS)._
These setups include [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System),
network drives such as [SMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block) and
[Samba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)).
Based on user reports, running read-write workloads on network-attached storage can result in slow and unpredictable performance,
as well as spurious errors cased by the underlying file system.

> Warning Avoid running DuckDB in read-write mode on network-attached storage.

> Bestpractice Fast disks are important if your workload is larger than memory and/or fast data loading is important. Only use network-backed disks if they are reliable (e.g., cloud disks) and guarantee high IO.

## Operating System

We recommend using the latest stable version of operating systems: macOS, Windows, and Linux are all well-tested and DuckDB can run on them with high performance. Among Linux distributions, we recommended using Ubuntu Linux LTS due to its stability and the fact that most of DuckDBâ€™s Linux test suite jobs run on Ubuntu workers.
