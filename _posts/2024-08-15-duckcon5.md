We are excited to hold the next "DuckCon" DuckDB user group meeting in **Seattle, WA**, sponsored by [MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/).
The meeting will take place on August 15, 2024 (Thursday) in the [SIFF Cinema Egyptian](https://www.siff.net/cinema/cinema-venues/siff-cinema-egyptian), located at [805 E Pine St, Seattle, WA, 98122](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jRfRPMaYY6AmJ2fF6).

As is traditional in DuckCons, we will start with a talk from DuckDB's creators [Hannes Mühleisen](https://hannes.muehleisen.org/) and [Mark Raasveldt](https://mytherin.github.io/) about the state of DuckDB. This will be followed by presentations by DuckDB users. In addition, we will have several lightning talks from the DuckDB community.
