We are excited to hold the next “DuckCon” DuckDB user group meeting in **Amsterdam, the Netherlands**.

The meeting will take place on January 31, 2025 (Friday). The [FOSDEM 2025 conference in Brussels](https://fosdem.org/2025/) is happening on the weekend after DuckCon #6, so you can conveniently travel there via a [direct train](https://www.nsinternational.com/).

As is traditional in DuckCons, we will start with a talk from DuckDB's creators [Hannes Mühleisen](https://hannes.muehleisen.org/) and [Mark Raasveldt](https://mytherin.github.io/) about the state of DuckDB. This will be followed by presentations from the DuckDB community.
